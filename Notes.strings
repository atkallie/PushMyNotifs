There are a lot of setup instructions for push notifications, most of which can be found here:
 
 https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client
 https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/certs
 https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/first-message

After you set up the necessary certificates and such, be sure to turn on 'Push Notifications' in the Capabilities tab of the PushMyNotifs.xcodeproj file to add entitlements

 Install 'Firebase/Messaging' Pod
 
 Then configure the app delegate file to use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
